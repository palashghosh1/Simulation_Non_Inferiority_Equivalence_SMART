# Instruction to use the Shiny App:

Please read this document to use the [Shiny Web App for Data analysis tool and Sample Size Calculator for Non-Inferiority and Equivalence tests in SMART.](http://13.250.172.122/shiny/NI_EQ/)



## What can be done in the Shiny App:

1. Calculate the minimum sample size required for the Non-Inferiority test in SMART.

2. Calculate the minimum sample size required for the Equivalence test in SMART. 

3. Do the data analysis based on your completed SMART data.




## How to calculate the minimum sample size required for Non-Inferiority test in SMART:

In a non-inferiority testing, the goal is to establish that a new intervention (say AI #1, which is cost-effective or less burdensome) yields favorable outcomes that, when compared to another active control (say AI #3) intervention (i.e., an intervention approach with established evidence of effectiveness), is not below some pre-stated non-inferiority margin.

1. Go to the [app.](http://13.250.172.122/shiny/NI_EQ/)
2. Set the significance level. The default value is 0.05.
3. Set the desired power for the non-inferiority test. The default value is 0.80.
4. Set the standardized effect size. The default value is 0.3. The Standardized Effect Size = (The standardized Non-Inferiority margin) - (The standardized mean difference). See the 'Non-Inferiority Test' section of the paper given in reference for details.
5. The app will automatically update to show the minimum sample size for your inputed values in the last line of the page. For selected default values of above input parameters, the estimated total sample size (includes all AIs) needed in the SMART is 138.
