# Instruction to use the Shiny App:

Please read this document to use the [Shiny Web App for Data analysis tool and Sample Size Calculator for Non-Inferiority and Equivalence tests in SMART.](http://13.250.172.122/shiny/NI_EQ/)

## What can be done in the Shiny App:

1. Calculate the minmum sample sizes required for Non-Inferiority test in SMART.

2. Calculate the minmum sample sizes required for Equivalence test in SMART. 

3. Do the data analysis based on your completed SMART data.
