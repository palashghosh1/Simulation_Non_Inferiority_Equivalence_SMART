# Instruction to use the Shiny App:

Please read this document to use the [Shiny Web App for Data analysis tool and Sample Size Calculator for Non-Inferiority and Equivalence tests in SMART.](http://13.250.172.122/shiny/NI_EQ/)



## What can be done in the Shiny App:

1. Calculate the minmum sample size required for Non-Inferiority test in SMART.

2. Calculate the minmum sample size required for Equivalence test in SMART. 

3. Do the data analysis based on your completed SMART data.




## How to calculate the minmum sample size required for Non-Inferiority test in SMART:

In a non-inferiority testing, the goal is to establish that a new intervention (say AI #1, which is cost-effective or less burdensome) yields favorable outcomes that, when compared to another active control (say AI #3) intervention (i.e., an intervention approach with established evidence of effectiveness), is not below some pre-stated non-inferiority margin.
